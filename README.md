# Myco

Myco is my dream for a personal plain text task management, note-taking assistant, and activity feed.

## Inspiration

Task management:

- [Tasks.md](https://github.com/BaldissaraMatheus/Tasks.md)
- [Todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt)

Note-taking:

- "Zettelkasten" projects like [zk](https://github.com/zk-org/zk)
- "Second brain"

Activity feed:

- "Digital garden"
